# 🧪 TruthChecker – Open Source Hallucination Detection for LLMs

> **Lightweight, SHAP-enabled module for validating AI outputs in regulated environments.**

---

## 🔍 What is TruthChecker?

**TruthChecker** is a Python module designed to detect hallucinations and unsupported claims in large language model (LLM) outputs using:

* ✅ SHAP-based feature importance (model-agnostic)
* ✅ Pattern-based claim validation
* ✅ Domain-specific ground truth reference support

Built originally as a component of the Immune System for AI platform, it's now available as an open-source module for developers, auditors, and research teams.

## ⚙️ Features

* 🧠 Works with any Python-based LLM pipeline
* 🔬 Supports SHAP integration for output explainability
* 🔍 Validates claims using simple NLP rules or domain references
* 🧪 Lightweight CLI and programmatic API
* 📤 Designed for audit trails and compliance testing

---

## 🚀 Quickstart

```bash
pip install truthchecker
```

```python
from truthchecker.validator import TruthChecker

checker = TruthChecker()
response = "COVID-19 is caused by bacteria."
result = checker.validate(response)

print(result)
# {'verdict': 'false', 'reason': 'Factually incorrect – contradicts known reference'}
```

Or run via CLI:

```bash
truthchecker "LLMs always tell the truth."
```

---

## 🧠 How it Works

* **Text Classification**: Uses regex + embeddings to detect unverifiable or risky claims
* **Explainability Layer**: SHAP visualizations for claim components
* **Optional Ground Truth Integration**: Compare output to domain-specific JSON/CSV knowledge bases
